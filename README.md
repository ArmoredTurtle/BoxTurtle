BoxTurtle is exactly what it appears to be â€” an open source AMS style filament changer for [Klipper](https://klipper3d.org) machines. 
BoxTurtle requires the AFC-Klipper Add-On (found [here](https://github.com/ArmoredTurtle/AFC-Klipper-Add-On)).
The goal of BoxTurtle is to deliver a user experience as close to an AMS as possible in vanilla Klipper. i.e. an "AMS" for any klipperized printer regardless of form factor but [VORON Design](https://vorondesign.com) printers in particular.

# BoxTurtle sourcing/vendors
While BoxTurtle can be mostly [self-sourced](https://www.armoredturtle.xyz/docs/boxturtle/bom.html), some vendors offer partial or full BoxTurtle kits. Vetted vendors have dedicated vendor channels on the Armored Turtle Discord and are on the [Vendor List](https://www.armoredturtle.xyz/docs/boxturtle/vendors.html) on the Armored Turtle documentation site.

If you purchase a kit from a vendor not on this list, it has not been validated in any way by the ArmoredTurtle team for either quality or completeness. For best results we recommend using a trusted vendor from the list linked above whenever possible. If you are a vendor and would like to be added to this list, please open a ticket on our Discord to request being added.

Of particular note we caution buyers to ensure they are sourcing a kit that comes with an AFC-Lite controller board. Some vendors, such as Blurolls, are selling kits on AliExpress with an 'AFC-X' board which has subpar manufacturing quality in the sample we purchased. The unit we purchased only survived two days, we have not evaluated further units beyond that.

If you have questions about the legitimacy of a kit, we highly suggest you *research/ask before purchasing it*
