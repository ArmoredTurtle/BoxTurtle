BoxTurtle is exactly what it appears to be â€” an open source AMS style filament changer for [Klipper](https://klipper3d.org) machines. 
BoxTurtle requires the AFC-Klipper Add-On (found [here](https://github.com/ArmoredTurtle/AFC-Klipper-Add-On)).
The goal of BoxTurtle is to deliver a user experience as close to an AMS as possible in vanilla Klipper. i.e. an "AMS" for any klipperized printer regardless of form factor but [VORON Design](https://vorondesign.com) printers in particular.
