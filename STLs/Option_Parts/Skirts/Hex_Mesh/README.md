Monolith skirts with modeled in Hexagon meshes, courtesy of [Steve Builds](https://github.com/stvptrsn/Printer_Stuff/tree/main/BoxTurtle/Skirts).

Front and rear skirts require a minimum 300mm x 300mm bed to print. If you bed is smaller you can use the cut tool in your slicer to split them to size, or use the pre-cut STLs in this repository.
